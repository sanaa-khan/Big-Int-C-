# Big-Int-C++-
The big integer class is used for mathematical operation which involves very big integer calculations that are outside the limit of all available primitive data types. For example factorial of 100 contains 158 digits in it so it cannot be stored in any primitive data type. This is a representation of big integer, written in pure C++. 

The "number" is actually represented with a dynamic character array in this implementation.
