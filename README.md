# Big-Int-C-
The big integer class is used for mathematical operation which involves very big integer calculations that are outside the limit of all available primitive data types. For example factorial of 100 contains 158 digits in it so we can't store it in any primitive data type available. This is a representation of big integer, written in pure C++.
